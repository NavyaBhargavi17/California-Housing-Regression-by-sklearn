# California Housing Regression Project 🏡

This project applies **Linear Regression** to the **California Housing dataset** using `scikit-learn`. It predicts house prices based on multiple features and visualizes the model performance.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy

## 📌 Steps Followed

1. Loaded the California Housing dataset
2. Explored and visualized the data
3. Preprocessed and split the data
4. Trained a Linear Regression model
5. Evaluated performance using Mean Squared Error and R² Score
6. Visualized Actual vs Predicted prices
